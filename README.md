# Psychic-Game

This game picks a random letter (a-z) and the user has nine guesses to match it.  

If the user matches the random letter in 9 guesses or less, it is comnsidered a "win" and 1 is added to the win totals

If the user does not match the random letter in 9 guesses or less, it is comnsidered a "loss" and 1 is added to the loss totals

Any key pressed that is not a-z will be discarded

The game continues for as long as the user keeps the browser window open.
